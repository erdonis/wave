# Wave

Hello, my name is Erdonis and this is a simple social media site I built with a special function.
This social site is aimed at helping with productivity and internet addiction.
It has a built-in function that makes it possible to only use it one hour per day, stacked throughout the day each time a user logs in.
Once the daily usage allowance is used up, the site will become inaccesible for the user until 00:00 their local time.
This is done for the purpose of using social media in a controlled manner and avoid becoming addicted to it.
